This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that illustrates how to install and
use [3LC](https://3lc.ai) for use on Google Colab.

In order to use this notebook, a commercial license to 3LC must have been
provided and it also requires a paid [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com) plan.

Furthermore, an [Ngrok](https://grok.com) account is required to set up the networking
tunnels.
